# Word Wizz
**An IOS Application replicating two versions of the Scramble Game**

Word Wizz is an app that allows the user to play two games depending on their choice. Each time the app is opened, a welcome page is displayed.
In this welcome page, the user is given the option to select their game mode as well as instructions for how to play and score.

## Game Options
**Scramble Game**
  - Regular Scramble, given a set of letters, create as many valid words as possible

**New York Times Scramble**
  - Given a set of letters and a key letter highlighted in yellow, create as many valid words as possible. You must use the key letter in every word created.
