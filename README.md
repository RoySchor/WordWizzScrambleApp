# Word Wizz
**An IOS Application replicating two versions of the Scramble Game**

Word Wizz is an app that allows the user to play two games depending on their choice. Each time the app is opened, a welcome page is displayed.
In this welcome page, the user is given the option to select their game mode as well as instructions for how to play and how the game is scored.

## Game Options
**Scramble Game**
  - Regular Scramble, given a set of letters, create as many valid words as possible

**New York Times Scramble**
  - Given a set of letters and a key letter highlighted in yellow, create as many valid words as possible. You must use the key letter in every word created.
